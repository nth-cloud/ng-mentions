## Installation

We strongly recommend using [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) for setting up a new project. If you have an Angular &ge; 9 CLI project, you could simply use our schematics to add ng-mentions library to it.

Just run the following:

```shell
ng add @nth-cloud/ng-mentions
```

It will install ng-mentions for the default application specified in your `angular.json`.
If you have multiple projects and you want to target a specific application, you could specify the `--project` option:

```shell
ng add @nth-cloud/ng-mentions --project myProject
```

If you prefer not to use schematics and install everything manually, please refer to the
[manual installation instructions](https://nth-cloud.github.io/ng-mentions/#/home) on our website.

## Supported browsers
We strive to support the same browsers and versions as supported by Angular.
See [Angular Browser Support](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
